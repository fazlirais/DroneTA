# DroneTA ‚Äì Automatic Leaf Disease Detection using Drone & Node-RED

This project integrates **drone autonomous path mapping**, **image-based disease detection (YOLOv8)**, and a **Node-RED dashboard** for real-time monitoring of cassava leaf diseases.  
It consists of multiple environments for local simulation, drone execution, and dashboard visualization.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

To execute this leaf disease detection project, you will need the following components:

### Hardware
- **Drone with ArduPilot-based flight controller** (e.g., Pixhawk, Cube, etc.)
- **Companion computer** (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano, or similar SBC)
- **Camera** that can be connected to the companion computer (USB or CSI camera)

### Software
- **Mission Planner** (used to simulate the drone flight before executing it in real flight)
- **Python 3.8+** (recommended version for compatibility with DroneKit and YOLOv8)
- **requirements.txt** (contains all necessary Python dependencies; install with `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

### Hardware Used in This Project
For this project, the following hardware configuration was used:
- **Flight Controller**: Pixhawk 2.4.8  
- **Companion Computer**: Raspberry Pi 4B  
- **Camera**: Raspberry Pi Camera Module

With this setup, the drone used in the project is as follows:

## üì° Leaf Disease Geolocation
To determine the real-world location of diseased plants, an algorithm is applied to convert the pixel position of the detected disease in the image into its actual geographic position.  
This process leverages several parameters, including the drone‚Äôs GPS location, altitude, field of view (FOV), and camera specifications.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

### 1. **LocalEnv/**
Code to be run on the **local machine (laptop/PC)** for drone path mapping and SITL (Mission Planner) simulation.

- **KeyPressModule.py** ‚Üí Converts keyboard input into Pygame window input (e.g., pressing "left" sends a left movement to Pygame).  
- **Mapping.py** ‚Üí Mapping program for drone path using keyboard input and displaying it in Pygame. The result is saved in `vals_data.txt`.  
- **vals_data.txt** ‚Üí Contains drone movement commands (forward/backward, left/right, yaw, initial location).  
- **best(2).pt** ‚Üí Trained YOLOv8 model for detecting cassava leaf diseases.  
- **Terrain.jpg** ‚Üí Image of the farming area, used as a mapping reference in Pygame.  

---

### 2. **DroneEnv/**
Code to be run on the **Raspberry Pi (companion computer)** onboard the drone.  
Responsible for executing flight commands, capturing plant images, running YOLO inference, and geolocation processing.

- **DroneControl.py** ‚Üí Main code for automatic leaf disease detection. Executes path commands from `vals_data.txt`, captures images, processes them with YOLOv8, generates geolocation plots, and pushes results to GitHub.  
- **best(2).pt** ‚Üí YOLOv8 model used on the drone.  
- **Terrain_capture.py** ‚Üí Captures `Terrain.jpg` by flying the drone to a set altitude and taking an overview photo of the farm.  
- **vals_data.txt** ‚Üí Drone path commands (copied from LocalEnv).  

---

### 3. **Images/**
Contains **plots and detection results** uploaded by the drone and later displayed on the Node-RED dashboard:

- `Drone Path Map.jpg` ‚Üí Map of the drone‚Äôs flown path.  
- `merged_output.jpg` ‚Üí Map of the combined disease detection result.  
- `scatter_Chlorosis.png`, `scatter_Gulma.png`, `scatter_Leaf Spot.png`, `scatter_Necrosis.png`, `scatter_Pest.png` ‚Üí Scatter plots of detected diseases.  
- `scatter_all.png` ‚Üí Combined scatter plot of all detected diseases.  

---

### 4. **Node-RED/**
Contains the Node-RED flow for the **dashboard visualization**.

- **flows_DroneTA.json** ‚Üí Node-RED flow export file to be imported into Node-RED to set up the dashboard.
